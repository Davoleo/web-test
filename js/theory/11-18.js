/*
Math Operators
a + b : Returns the sum of a and b
a - b : Returns the subtraction of a and b
a * b : Returns the multiplication of a and b
a / b : Returns the division of a and b
a % b : Returns the remainder of the division a / b (Modulus operator)
a++   : Increments a by one
a--   : Decrements a by one

Assignment Operators
v = 9 : Assigns the value on the right to the variable (v) on the left
v += 24 : Adds the value on the right to the value of variable on the left and saves the new v value
v -= 24 : Subtracts the value on the right to the value of variable on the left and saves the new v value
v *= 24 : Multiplies the value on the right to the value of variable on the left and saves the new v value
v /= 24 : Divides the value on the right to the value of variable on the left and saves the new v value
