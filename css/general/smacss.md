## 5 Different Kinds of Rules
- **Base rules** are the defaults. 
They are almost exclusively single element selectors but it could include attribute selectors,
 pseudo-class selectors, child selectors or sibling selectors. 
 Essentially, a base style says that wherever this element is on the page, 
 it should look like this.
  
- **Layout rules** divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules together.

- **Modules** are the reusable, modular parts of our design. 
They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on.

- **State Rules**  are ways to describe how our modules or layouts 
will look when in a particular state. Is it hidden or expanded? 
Is it active or inactive? 
They are about describing how a module or layout looks on screens that are smaller or bigger.
They are also about describing how a module might look in different views like the home page
 or the inside page.
 
- **Theme rules** are similar to state rules 
 in that they describe how modules or layouts might look. 
 Most sites donâ€™t require a layer of theming but it is good to be aware of it.
